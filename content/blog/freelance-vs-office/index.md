## How I started
I started my freelance way in 2020. When the pandemic just started I had an idea to continue learning Web Development. I had some knowledge from a college. We had Web Development and Design classes. It helped me and I’m so happy I had good professors in a college. The most pros of freelance are that you can get a lot of useful information and will be only plus when you wish to find a job. For example, you can understand people that understand nothing in your field. Another plus is work in different languages. You can do projects for people from the USA, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Europe, all over the world. I did a website for a guy from Canada. He ordered a website about stanchions. If you know more pros of freelancing, let me know in the comments.

After that, I got some more orders. I have 5 completed orders at this moment. I do have not many services now as I had before. My services now are: creating websites using CMS like WordPress, and Shopify or using web builders such as Webflow and Squarespace. In super rare cases I can take HTML and CSS orders.

I got a job in October and continued to do freelancing. It was not so hard. I was do freelance projects in the morning and in the evening after a full-time job.

## What to choose? Freelance or office?
That’s the main question. I can’t answer like you need to work in an office or to go freelance. You need to try both and make a decision. What do you like more? That’s a question you need to answer. Do you prefer working with a boss with good people around you? Or maybe you prefer working alone where you are a manager, designer, developer all rolled into one. By the way, you can mix, but it's kind of hard.

## Benefits of working in office
First things first is work in office is good opportunity for people who like communication. You have a lot of smart people around you. I had 5 backend guys in a room, there are 6 computers. That means I was the only frontend guy in the room. Every guy has some unique information and experience. Just think about it. The second benefit is a kitchen where every day you can find snacks, milk, water, etc. But in some offices you will don't find this. The third benefit of working in an office is table tennis. I’m not sure all companies have the table tennis. But maybe your company has a pool table. The fourth benefit is a library. In our company we can take a book from the library and take it home and read it everywhere we need to. I think it’s super cool.

## Benefits of freelance
Freelance is freedom. Yes and no. Freelance means you will be alone and you can’t cancel an order without rating impact. The first benefit is a work schedule. You can work 2 hours a day or 12 hours a day. You can wake up at 5 AM or 2 PM. You are the boss of your work. The second benefit is interesting projects. You will have customers from all over the world with different requests from pet houses to divorce calculators. I’m saying about website creation right now. All I can say here is just do what you like.

## Working freelance and at home really effective?
This is the main question of this article. Is it effective? I think yes. You can increase your profit twice, have good projects, and meet awesome people (sometimes not so awesome). But you will need to work more, too more.You will work at a full-time job and work right after it. It’s hard if you will do it every day. I’m spending 2 hours per day on a freelance and at this moment it works well. I will say later how it goes. Stay tuned! 

UPD: I reposted this article and can say how it goes now. I can say that I will not take freelance projects in the future for some time. I need to focus on my life and education. I need to learn a lot of new technologies, shoot videos on three YouTube channels (as minimum one). 

So, thanks for reading this short article. I'm happy to see that my content is really useful and interesting for people. See you soon!
