## How I started?
I wrote an article several months ago when landed a job as a Shopify Developer. You can read it **[here](https://medium.com/@devmoek/my-journey-from-zero-to-got-an-offer-in-tech-company-b1718ca8ab20)**. Now I boosted my skills and feel myself much better with Shopify. By the way, I don't have enough experience to develop headless e-commerce websites which is [Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/), but I'm on the way. I took Udemy courses to learn React to be able to write clean and perfomance code.

When I found the job, my experience with Shopify was almost a zero. I had understanding about HTML, CSS, JS but my experience with JSON, liquid and Shopify platform as well was not enough to do what I develop and customize now. And this is great. It means my skills is growing. 

### Vintage themes
When I just came to the company there was several Shopify project with a vintage theme. It's now called like that because we have 2.0 themes. So these themes, vintage ones, it's less customizable then 2.0 themes. And I understood that, especially when worked with 2.0 themes and after that maintain a vintage one, it feels different. First things first is JSON templates.

### JSON templates
In vintage themes you will see liquid templates. For example `page.liquid`. Liquid templates less handy when you need to add some new content to website's pages. When you have JSON templates, you will be able to add any section you have in sections folder to any page with `.json` extension.

### Third party themes vs Shopify themes
You can see a whole bunch of themes out there. And probably you have a reasonable question like **What theme should I choose for my store?** So it's a complex question and you need to understand what you'll do with your store. I mean *how* you want to prepare it and *who* will do that. You can hire a developer or do all work by yourself. In my experience, third party themes are not good (not all, but a lot). You need to check a theme you want to buy, like check-check and check, a lot of check. Not just check the design and say something like yeah it's nice let's go create a store.

By the way, I think not all theme developers will show the code. I sure everyone will decline a request to show a theme code. Why you need to check the code? In the code you can see mistakes, errors, etc. I saw that with my eyes and this experience is not good at all. If you are just started learning Shopify development, I'll recommend [Dawn theme](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/dawn/styles/default) to start with. It's super optimized and have a clean code. Oh, and Dawn have all you need under the hood to launch a store. Almost all. There is no recently viewed items section functionality. But I have a video on my YouTube channel about [how to add recently viewed items section in Shopify Dawn theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk7KzAFPP5E&t). 

### Tips and tricks
These tips can help you to land your Shopify store:
1. Check theme documentation (if you bought a thirt-party theme). In a theme documentation you will read a guide from a theme developer, where to find some features, what apps you need in a theme and much more.
2. Connect your theme to GitHub repository. This will help you to track all changes in your theme.
3. Change pages templates from liquid to JSON (if you don't have it). I wrote before why it's important.
4. Before doing some changes in your live theme, don't forget to create a theme copy.
5. Use Shopify CLI. It's more handy than the code editor in Shopify.
