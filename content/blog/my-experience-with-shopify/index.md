## How I started?
I wrote an article several months ago when landed a job as a Shopify Developer. You can read it [here](). // put a link on the article. Now I boosted my skills so well. By the way I don't have enought experience to develop headless e-commerce websites, but I'm on the way. I took Udemy courses to learn React to be able to write clean and perfomance code.

## What I learned 
When I found the job, my experience with Shopify was almost zero. I had understanding about HTML, CSS, JS but my experience with JSON, liquid and Shopify platform as well was not enough to do what I develop and customize now. And this is great. It means my skills is growing. 

### Vintage themes
When I just came to the company there will one Shopify project with vintage theme. It's now called like that because we have 2.0 themes. So this themes, vintage ones, it's less customizable then 2.0 themes. And I understood that, especially when worked with 2.0 themes and after that maintain this old theme, it feels another. First things first is JSON templates.

### JSON templates
In vintage themes you will see liquid templates. It's less handy to add new content to website's pages. When you have JSON templates, you will be able to add any section you have in sections folder to any page with .json extension. I have a video on my YouTube channel about how to change page templates from liquid to JSON, watch it.

### Third party themes vs Shopify themes
You can see a whole bunch of themes out there. What theme should you choose for your store? So it's complex question and you need to understand what you will do with your store. I mean how you will prepare it and who will prepare it. You can hire a developer or do all work by yourself. In my experience, third party themes are not good (almost all). You need to check a theme you want to buy, like check-check. Not just check the design and say yeah it's nice let's go. By the way, I think not all theme developers will show the code. Because exactly in the code you can see mistakes, errors, etc. I saw that with my eyes and this experience is not good at all. If you are just started learning Shopify development, I can recommend Dawn theme. It's super optimized and have super clean code. Thanks for the Shopify developers. They did a really great job to provide a theme that have almost everything you need to start selling online.

### Tips and tricks
These tips can help you to land your Shopify store:
* Check theme documentation (if you bought a thirt-party theme). 
  In a theme documentation you will read a guide from a theme developer, where to find some features, what apps you need in a theme and much more.
* Connect your theme to GitHub repository
  This will help you to track all changes in your theme.
* Change pages templates from liquid to JSON (if you don't have it)
  I wrote before why it's important.
* Before doing some changes in your live theme, don't forget to create a theme copy.
